Hello, my name is Liana. I programmed VisuaLisPy as my Hackbright Academy project. 
</p>
I hold a certain aversion to black boxes, always wanting to open them up and take a peek inside. Since I began programming, I wanted to know how a computer actually understands these languages. Thus, I chose to build an interpreter for the sake of learning some inner workings of language processing. Hackbright instructor Liz said something quite accurate of me, “You really like the abstract, but you get frustrated if you can’t represent it visually.” 
</p>
How do I present an interpreter in a visual format? And so, I set off to build VisuaLisPy -- a web-based language interpretation visualizer. Working off of Peter Norvig's <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html">Lispy</a>, I wrote an interpreter for Scheme (a dialect of Lisp) using Python. The interpreter file was modified to output JSON, which is passed to the browser and rendered visually using the <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> JavaScript library. 
</p>
In line with my love for open education, I hope VisuaLisPy will be helpful for those who want to better understand language interpretation.
